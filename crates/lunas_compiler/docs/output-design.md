# Lunas compiled-output design & runtime contract

This document specifies what the Lunas code generator emits (the compiled `.js`
for a component) and the minimal runtime it targets. It is the design that
follows from the investigation recorded in this project's discussion: every
non-obvious decision here is backed by a cross-hardware micro-benchmark
(Apple Silicon Mac + 3× GCP `Xeon@2.20GHz, 2 vCPU` Debian VMs, Chrome/Blink 149).

The generator's **input** is a `ResolvedComponent` (see `lunas_compiler`): the
numbered reactive variables, each dynamic template part with its dependency
mask, and each handler with its write mask. This document is the **output** side.

---

## 1. Where the speed comes from (two levers)

Lunas is fast at *initial render*, and the speed has two compounding sources:

1. **Static DOM is built by the browser's native parser in bulk** via
   `innerHTML`, with dynamic parts excluded and represented as lightweight
   anchors. The static string is kept as large and contiguous as possible, so a
   mostly-static component is essentially one parse.
2. **Dependencies are resolved at compile time**, so runtime reactivity setup is
   nearly free — just registering precomputed dependency bits. There is no
   runtime dependency-tracking graph, no per-part effect closures, no VDOM.

Updates are not "magically light"; the win is *construction offloaded to the
native parser* + *near-zero reactivity setup*.

---

## 2. Construction strategy (benchmark-locked)

| Decision | Why (measured) |
|---|---|
| **Static build = `innerHTML`**, not `cloneNode` | `clone+append` is **1.1–1.32× slower** than `innerHTML` on every machine tested; the gap widens slightly on slower CPUs. `cloneNode` skips parsing but needs a separate adopt step, and Blink's parse is faster than the copy. |
| **No comments in the static HTML** | A comment node (`<!>` *or* `<!---->`) drops Blink out of its fast-path HTML parser: the whole `innerHTML` becomes **~4–6× slower**. Hardware-independent. |
| **Anchors = runtime text nodes** (`createTextNode`+`insertBefore`), created after the parse | Keeps the static HTML comment-free (fast path) while still marking dynamic insertion points. This is what the original Lunas did, and it is correct. |
| **Element refs = positional navigation** (`firstChild`/`nextSibling`/`childNodes[i]`), not `id`+`getElementById` | Positional nav is **~2× faster** (0.45–0.66×) across all machines, works on a *detached* tree, and needs no id bytes, hash lookups, or `removeAttribute` cleanup. |
| **Static HTML is whitespace-free and comment-free** | Whitespace-free ⇒ stable `childNodes` positions for nav (and smaller output). Comment-free ⇒ fast path. |
| **Build detached → wire → attach once** | Because positional nav needs no document attachment (unlike `getElementById`), all wiring happens off-DOM; the live tree is touched exactly once. |

> Note: the fast-path-parser penalty is a Blink characteristic. Gecko/WebKit
> were **not** measured; re-verify before relying on the comment penalty there.

## 3. Component output contract

A component compiles to a factory function. Example — a counter with reactive
text, an event handler, an `:if`, and a `:for` over a deeply-mutated array:

```js
import { component, box, deepBox, refs, on, bind, ifBlock, forBlock } from "lunas";

// Static skeleton: comment-free, whitespace-free. Dynamic seams are NOT here;
// they become runtime anchors. Hoisted once per module.
const HTML = `<button>+1</button><p></p><ul></ul>`;

export default component("div", { class: "counter" }, HTML, (c, props) => {
  // Only mutated bindings are boxed. The compiler picks the box kind per var,
  // and gives each a reactive index (0, 1, …):
  const count   = box(c, 0, props.start ?? 0);  // index 0: reassigned only
  const history = deepBox(c, 1, []);             // index 1: array .push() -> touch()

  function inc() { count.v++; (history.touch(), history.v.push(count.v)); }

  // Positional nav to the dynamic elements (detached, no ids).
  const [btn, p, ul] = refs(c.root, [[0], [1], [2]]);

  on(btn, "click", inc);

  // Reactive part: (dep indices it reads, updateFn). Runs on flush only when one
  // of its deps changed.
  bind(c, [0], () => { p.textContent = `count: ${count.v}`; });

  // :if count > 0  — anchor inserted before `ul` at build time.
  ifBlock(c, /*anchor before*/ ul, [0], () => count.v > 0, POSITIVE);

  // :for n of history — anchor inside `ul`.
  forBlock(c, ul, [1], () => history.v, ITEM);
});
```

- **Root**: `document.createElement("div")` + attributes, then
  `root.innerHTML = HTML`. Single-root is the fast common path. A multi-root
  component omits the wrapper and builds a fragment (see §7).
- **`HTML`** is hoisted at module scope so it is defined once and shared by all
  instances (the string, not the DOM — each instance re-parses it, which the
  benchmark shows is cheaper than cloning).

---

## 4. Reactivity model (compile-time dependency dispatch)

This is the evolution of Lunas's existing model (Svelte-4 family), **not**
auto-tracking signals.

- Each reactive variable has an **index** (`ResolvedComponent.reactive_vars[i].index`).
- Each dynamic part knows the **set of variable indices it reads**
  (`dynamics[j].deps`), already expanded transitively through function calls at
  compile time.
- A write **enqueues that variable's dependent update functions** (deduplicated);
  a microtask **flush** runs only the affected ones — not every dynamic part.
- **No runtime dependency discovery.** The graph is fully known at compile time.

### Per-variable box specialization (chosen by the compiler)

| Var classification (from analysis) | Box | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Reassigned only (`x = …`) | `box` — plain getter/setter that sets the bit | lightest |
| Deeply mutated (`arr.push`, `obj.k = …`) | `deepBox` — raw value + compiler-injected `touch()`/`touchElem()` invalidation | no Proxy; a deep mutation costs one bit-set, same as a reassign |
| Shared across components (passed as prop and mutated) | `shared` — sets the dirty bit in *every* dependent component | cross-component without signals |

This resolves the classic weaknesses of pure static wiring (deep mutation,
cross-component flow) **at compile time**, avoiding a runtime hybrid.

#### Deep mutation is compiler-instrumented, not Proxy-intercepted

`deepBox.v` returns the **raw** value — reads are as cheap as a plain `box`, and
the reconciler hot path reads it directly. A deep mutation is made reactive by an
explicit invalidation the compiler emits right after the mutating statement (the
Svelte-family model), never a runtime Proxy:

```
arr.push(x)        ->  (arr.touch(), arr.v.push(x))
obj.k = v          ->  (obj.touch(), obj.v.k = v)
rows[i].label = x  ->  (rows.touchElem(rows.v[i]), rows.v[i].label = x)
```

`touch()` marks the variable dirty (structural change); `touchElem(el)` marks it
and records the mutated array element so a `:for` can patch just that item
(fine-grained item updates) without a Proxy attributing the write. `markVar`
defers the flush to a microtask, so it is irrelevant that the injected call runs
before the mutation completes within the statement. The compiler finds mutation
sites over the real AST (`lunas_script::deep_mutation_sites`); element-field
attribution is used only for the side-effect-free `X[idx].field` shape, and a
plain structural `touch()` is the always-correct fallback for everything else.

Why not a Proxy: a Proxy makes every nested get/set a trap dispatch plus (for
`:for` element attribution) WeakMap bookkeeping, which measured **~10× the cost
of a raw write** on the deep-mutation hot path (`js-framework-benchmark`'s
"partial update" / "swap" rows) — precisely where a Proxy-based Lunas gave up its
structural lead to Svelte, which compiles mutations to direct writes. Removing it
roughly **halves** the wall-clock of those operations while keeping identical
semantics.

**Which mutation forms are instrumented.** The compiler recognizes deep
mutations over the AST (`lunas_script::deep_mutation_sites`): direct member/index
writes (`x.k = v`, `x[i] = v`, `x[i].f = v`, `x.f++`, `delete x.k`), mutating
method calls (`push`/`splice`/`sort`/… and Map/Set `set`/`add`/`delete`/`clear`),
destructuring targets (`[x[0], x[1]] = …`), `Object.assign`/`defineProperty` on a
tracked value, and an iteration-callback that mutates elements
(`x.forEach(e => e.f = …)`, `x.map(e => (e.n = …, e))`) — the last recovered by a
conservative structural `touch()` when the callback body actually contains a
mutation, so a pure `filter`/`map` never over-notifies. **Known limitation
(Svelte-family):** a mutation reached *only* through a cross-function alias —
passing the value to a helper that mutates a differently-named parameter — is not
auto-instrumented; reassign the value or call `box.touch()` to make it reactive.

**Runaway-loop guard.** Because `touch()` is unconditional (no `old === new`
short-circuit — the compiler cannot cheaply prove a write was a no-op), a reactive
effect that mutates a dependency it reads no longer self-limits at value
convergence. The flush loop therefore bounds consecutive self-triggered passes
(`MAX_FLUSH_DEPTH`, aborting with a dev warning) — the same safeguard Vue applies
— so such an effect degrades to a bounded stop instead of hanging the page.

### Dispatch representation (no BigInt)

The graph is stored as **adjacency** by default: each reactive variable holds the
list of update functions that read it (the inverse of `dynamics[].deps`). A write
enqueues those functions; `flush` runs the queue, deduplicated by a per-function
flag. This makes `flush` cost **O(affected parts)** — unaffected dynamics are
never touched — and, being plain arrays, it has **no width limit and no overflow
case**. This aligns with Lunas's "many parallel dynamic blocks" target: an update
touches neither unrelated static DOM nor unrelated dynamic parts.

The compiler may specialize small components (≤ 31 reactive vars) to a single
`number` **bitmask** (`dirty |= 1<<i`; run binds where `mask & dirty`) for the
smallest constant factor. If a wide bitmask is ever preferred over adjacency, use
a `Uint32Array` of 32-bit chunks — **never `BigInt`**.

`BigInt` is rejected on two grounds: it is markedly slower than `number`
(heap-allocated, non-primitive) **and** it is the least compatible option (ES2020
/ Safari 14+, no efficient polyfill). With deep mutation now compiler-instrumented
(above), the runtime uses **no `Proxy`** either, so the reactive core is plain
ES2015 (`getter`/`setter`, arrays, `Map`/`Set`) — its floor is below Vue 3 /
Svelte 5 / Solid, which all rely on `Proxy`. Adjacency, `number`, and
`Uint32Array` all stay at or below that floor; `BigInt` would raise it above the
competition.

`handlers[].writes` is used at compile time for validation / dead-code
elimination; at runtime the box setter already enqueues dependents, so the write
mask is not needed live.

## 6. Syntax → output mapping

| `.lunas` | Output |
|---|---|
| `${expr}` (deps ≠ ∅) | `bind(c, deps, () => textNode.data = …)` on a text node |
| `${expr}` (deps = ∅) | assigned once at build, no `bind` |
| `:name="e"` | `bind(c, deps, () => setAttr(el, "name", e))` (or `el.prop =` for known props) |
| `::name="lv"` | above **+** `on(el, "input", () => lv = el.value)` (write-back) |
| `@event="h()"` | `on(el, "event", h)` — box setters notify, so no explicit write mask needed |
| `@event="n = n+1"` / `@event="n++"` / `@event="o.k = v"` (inline mutation) | `on(el, "event", () => { n.v = n.v+1 })` — the handler body is `.v`-rewritten (program-mode) so the inline assignment/update reaches the box setter and marks the var; the mutated binding is numbered reactive (its assignment target counts as a mutation). Multiple statements (`a++; b++`) and member/index writes (→ `deepBox`) are supported |
| static `class="a ${x}"` | text nodes / attr set; interpolations become `bind`s |
| `:if` / `:elseif` / `:else` | one `ifBlock` chain per cascade, anchored; branch built by its own `innerHTML` when shown. A branch body that is a **component tag** (`<Child :if=…/>`) mounts the child via `mountChild` inside the branch `make` (teardown rides the branch scope); a bare multi-child `<template :if>` unwraps into a multi-root branch (no literal `<template>`) |
| `:for="n of items"` | `forBlock`; **initial render = one `innerHTML` of the concatenated items**, updates = keyed diff. A **component** body (`<Child :for=…/>`) uses forBlock *mount mode*: one `mountChild` per item (props from the item) instead of a static item skeleton; the item `make` returns `{ node, patch }` and the child teardown rides the item scope |
| `<Child :p="e"/>` | `mountChild(c, anchor, Child, { p: () => e, static: "x" })` at an anchor; reactive props are getters, static props are values (see below) |
| `<Child @save="h($event)"/>` (parent) | an `onSave: ($event) => h($event)` entry on the mountChild props object; the child raises it with `emit("save", payload)` (§5, c-emits). `@save-all` → `onSaveAll` (camel-cased). Handler runs in the parent; it does not auto-mark the parent dirty |
| `emit("save", payload)` in a child `script` | the compiler detects the free `emit` call and injects, at the top of the child's `setup`, `registerEmits(c, props)` + `const emit = (name, payload) => $emit(c, name, payload)` (runtime `emit` imported as the `$emit` alias). The child's `emit("save", …)` then routes to the parent's `onSave` prop. A child that declares its own top-level `emit` opts out (no injection) |
| `@input name:type = v` | `const name = prop(c, "name", i, props.name, v)` at the top of `setup` — every prop is a reactive box (see below) |
| `:class="e"` | `setClass(el, "<static class>", e)` — `e` is `string \| { cls: bool } \| array` (nested), normalized and merged with the static `class` attr (`normClass`) |
| `:style="e"` | `setStyle(el, "<static style>", e)` — `e` is `string \| { camelCaseProp: v }` (arrays merge), camelCase → kebab, merged with the static `style` attr (`normStyle`) |
| `:html="e"` | `el.innerHTML = e` (initial + reactive). **XSS caveat:** the value is inserted verbatim — never bind untrusted input. Children on the same element are overwritten (a warning is emitted) |
| `:ref="name"` | `name.v = el` at wire time — exposes the element/child to the script via the reactive box `name` (declare `let name;` in script; the ref assignment makes it reactive so the resolver numbers it). Component refs expose the mount handle |
| `<component :is="e" :p="…" @ev="h($event)" :ref="r"/>` | `dynamicBlock(c, anchor, deps, () => e, { p: () => …, onEv: ($event) => { h($event) } })` — remounts the child factory `e` at the anchor when `:is` changes; props flow via `setProp`; `@ev` listeners wire as `on<Ev>` handler props (same as a static component tag); `:ref="r"` assigns the (stable) dynamicBlock handle to the box `r`. Any `@use` factory is importable by name (all `@use` imports are emitted when a `<component>` is present) |
| `<teleport to="sel">…</teleport>` | `teleportBlock(c, anchor, () => "sel", () => {…build children…})` — children render into `document.querySelector(sel)` (or an element via `:to="e"`) instead of inline; nodes removed on teardown |
| `<slot>fallback</slot>` (child) | `slotBlock(c, anchor, props.$slots && props.$slots["default"], () => {…fallback fragment…})` — renders the parent's default-slot content, else its own fallback |
| `<slot name="x"/>` (child) | `slotBlock(c, anchor, props.$slots && props.$slots["x"], fallbackOrNull)` — a named slot keyed by `x` |
| `<slot :item="e"/>` (child, scoped) | above **+** a trailing `() => ({ item: (e) })` scoped-props getter; the value flows up to the parent's slot content |
| `<Child>…</Child>` (parent, bare children) | a `default` entry on the mountChild `$slots` object: `default: (slotProps, onCleanup) => slotContent(c, (slotProps) => {…wire content in the PARENT…}, slotProps, onCleanup)` |
| `<template #x>…</template>` / `<template slot="x">…</template>` (parent) | an `x` entry on `$slots` (named slot). Bare `<template>` inlines its children into the `default` group |
| `<template #x="p">…</template>` (parent, scoped) | the inner build binds the scoped-slot props to `p`: `slotContent(c, (p) => {…read p.…}, slotProps, onCleanup)`. `slot="x" slot-scope="p"` is the long form. A bare `<template slot-scope="p">` / `<template #="p">` (no `slot=`/`#name`) scopes the **default** slot |

> **Scoped-slot reactivity (restricted form).** The child's scoped props
> (`<slot :item="e"/>`) are captured once, at slot build time, via
> `slotPropsOf()` — they are a *snapshot object*, not a live reactive channel.
> Parent slot content reads them through the bound name (`p.item`) and renders
> correctly on first paint; parent state that the content also reads stays fully
> reactive (parent-scope binds). What is **not** yet wired is the child later
> *mutating* a scoped value and having the parent content re-render — that needs
> a per-scoped-prop reactive bridge (analogous to `mountChild.setProp`, but
> child→parent). Deferred; slot props whose shape/values are fixed at build (the
> common case) work today. Making them live is additive on top of this contract.
| multi-root template (>1 top-level node) | `export default fragment({}, HTML, setup)` instead of `component(...)` — no wrapper element; the factory returns the child-node group carrying `__lunasCtx`, mountable/movable/unmountable as a unit (§7) |

### Child components & props (concretized)

`@input` props are **reactive**: a parent can change a prop after init, so a
child's template reads of a prop must re-run. The generator numbers each prop as
a reactive variable (after the script's reactive vars) and adopts it with the
`prop` helper:

```js
const name = prop(c, "name", i, props.name, defaultExpr /*, deep */);
```

`prop` seeds the box from `props.name` (calling it if the parent passed a getter,
else using the value), or from `defaultExpr` when the prop is omitted. It
registers the box under its name in `c._props` so a parent can drive it. The
optional `deep` flag selects a `deepBox` when the child deeply mutates the prop
locally.

The **parent** mounts a child and drives its reactive props:

```js
const a0 = anchorBefore(hostNode.childNodes[k]);
const ch0 = mountChild(c, a0, Child, { p: () => e, static: "x" });
bind(c, [deps of e], () => ch0.setProp("p", e));   // one per reactive prop
```

- **Reactive props** (`:p="e"`, or a static value with an interpolation) are
  passed as **getters** in the initial object (so the child seeds correctly at
  construction) *and* driven by a parent-side `bind` that calls
  `ch0.setProp("p", e)` on the expression's compile-time deps. The bind's initial
  run re-seeds the same value (the box no-ops on an equal write). Inside a `:for`
  item the driving bind is item-coupled (`bind(c, [], …)`), so `runScope`
  refreshes it when the item's data changes.
- **Static props** (`static="x"`, valueless `flag` → `true`) are plain values in
  the initial object; no driving bind is emitted.
- `mountChild` returns `{ root, ctx, setProp(name, value), unmount() }`.
  `setProp` writes `child._props[name].v`, which marks the **child** dirty and
  flushes the child. The two contexts are independent: a child event marks only
  the child, a parent prop push marks only the child — parent and child never
  cross-contaminate reactive state.

Child modules are imported from the `@use` table: `import Child from "path"`
with the path written verbatim (extension handling is the module resolver's
job — the compiler does not rewrite it). Only components actually used in the
template are imported; a colliding tag name (e.g. a component literally named
`bind`) is imported under a `$`-suffixed alias.

---

## 7. Build / mount lifecycle

1. `document.createElement(rootTag)` + set static attributes.
2. `root.innerHTML = HTML` — one native parse of the comment-free, whitespace-free
   static skeleton (all statics, no dynamic content).
3. **Positional nav** to grab refs to dynamic elements and control-flow insertion
   points (`refs(root, paths)`), all off-DOM.
4. **Create anchors** for `:if` / `:for` / child components as text nodes and
   `insertBefore` them at their positions.
5. Wire: `on(...)`, `bind(...)`, `ifBlock/forBlock/mountChild(...)`. `bind`
   performs the initial assignment, so the first paint is correct with no flush.
6. Return `root`; the caller attaches it to the live DOM **once**.

**Multi-root component**: skip the wrapper element — parse the interior into a
throwaway container (a `<template>`; see the table-context note below), take its
child nodes as the roots, and track the set (or a start/end anchor pair) so the
block can be removed/moved as a unit (§8).

**Fragment parsing goes through a `<template>` (table-context safety).** Every
detached fragment parse the runtime does — a `:for` item / bulk-item skeleton, an
`:if`/`ifChain` branch (`fromHTML`), and a multi-root `fragment(...)` — parses the
HTML as the content of a `<template>` element (`t.innerHTML = html; …t.content`),
not the `innerHTML` of a `<div>`. A `<template>`'s content fragment is a valid
insertion context for **any** element, whereas a `<div>` is not a valid table or
select insertion context: assigning `"<tr>…</tr>"` (or `<td>`/`<tbody>`/`<option>`
/`<col>`/…) as a `<div>`'s `innerHTML` makes the HTML parser **DROP** the
table/select tags, leaving an empty container whose `childNodes[0]` is `undefined`
— which crashed a keyed `:for`/`:if`/fragment whose item is a `<tr>` (etc.). The
shared `parseFragment(html, doc)` helper (dom.mjs) implements this, falling back to
a `<div>` only when `<template>`/`.content` is unavailable. The component **root**
build is unaffected (its static skeleton is the `innerHTML` of the `div` wrapper /
the component's own root tag, both valid contexts for table markup).

---

## 8. Anchors & control-flow details

- **`:if`**: a text anchor marks the slot. When the condition becomes true, the
  branch is built (its own `innerHTML`) and inserted before the anchor; when
  false, its nodes are removed. The anchor is permanent, so the slot position is
  always known.
- **`:for`**: initial render builds **all items as one `innerHTML` string** (the
  fast path), then wires each item. Updates use a keyed diff (insert / remove /
  move individual items); items are **not** re-`innerHTML`ed wholesale.
- **Fine-grained item-field updates**: when the iterable is exactly one
  `deepBox` variable (`item of rows`), the compiler additionally emits
  `box: rows` in the `forBlock` opts. `forBlock` then opts that box into element
  tracking (`box.observeElems()`), which lets the box distinguish a **structural**
  change (reassign / `push` / `splice` / `length` / `rows[i] = obj`) from a pure
  **element-field** write (`rows[i].label = x`, at any depth under an element).
  A structural change runs the full keyed reconcile as before; a field-only
  flush **patches just the touched items** — no `extractKeys` / LIS / whole-list
  patch — so an item-property change is O(changes), not O(N). Both cases still
  `markVar`, so every other dependent (computeds, `${rows.length}`, …) stays
  correct. Derived iterables (`rows.filter(…)`, a computed) get no `box:` and
  keep the coarse reconcile-on-change path. The reconciler iterates the box's
  **raw** array so the hot path never reads through element proxies.
- **Multi-root blocks** (a branch/item with several top-level nodes): track the
  node list, or delimit with a start/end anchor pair, so removal/move affects the
  whole group. Single-root blocks use the cheap one-node path (compiler picks).
- **Updates never call `innerHTML`.** Re-parsing would destroy state, listeners,
  focus, and selection. Updates are targeted node mutations + anchored insert/remove.

---

## 9. SSR readiness (deferred, but designed-for)

The static HTML string is exactly what a server would emit. Because anchors are
created at runtime (not embedded), **hydration reuses the CSR wiring path**: skip
`innerHTML` (the server DOM already exists), then run the same positional-nav +
anchor-creation + `bind` steps against the server-rendered subtree. Comment-free
HTML keeps server output small and avoids the parse penalty on the client's
initial document parse too. SSR is a later codegen mode; nothing here blocks it.

---

## 10. Compiler pipeline

```
.lunas → lunas_parser → lunas_script → lunas_compiler (ResolvedComponent) → codegen → this output
                                                            │
      reactive_vars (bits) · dynamics (dep masks) · handlers (write masks)
```

The generator consumes a `ResolvedComponent` and emits the shape above. It does
**not** re-analyze; all dependency resolution is already done.

---

## 11. Open / deferred

- Keyed-diff algorithm for `:for` updates (initial render is settled; reconcile
  strategy is not).
- SSR / hydration codegen mode.
- Cross-engine verification of the comment fast-path penalty (Blink measured;
  Gecko/WebKit not).
- Compile-time flattening of purely-static child components into the parent's
  static string (optional optimization).
